        Minimalism is defined as a design or style in which the simplest and
        fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect. It is the idea of
        owning less material things to give you room for the more important
        things in your life. The focus is to only have what brings you joy, or
        is of use to you, and to let go of the rest. It gives you the freedom to
        get rid of all the clutter that weighs you down so that you can focus on
        what matters most in life;
        <strong>
          <em>living</em>
        </strong>
        <br />
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Minimalism;
